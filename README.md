# Animesion
An end-to-end framework for anime-related object classification, detection, segmentation, and other models.

Update: 01/22/2020. Due to time-constraints I will for now just finish and publish the components for classification. Detection and segmentation require more adjustments to the pipelines, but I hope that the reslts published here encourage other researchers and hobbyists to further continue this project. If not hopefully I will be able to come back at it in a few months time from now.
