Anime character recognition/classification using PyTorch

# to do
first working version of anime waifu classifier. 
need to separate into training, validation and testing set. 
also add more loss functions. add more datasets: danbooru faces subset. 
need to try different architectures: resnet, img_transformer?
long tailed version requires resampling (use singan)
